### **Problem 1**

The difference in potential between the accelerating plates in the [electron gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_gun)(電子槍) of a TV picture tube is about $25000 V$ . If the distance between these plates is $1.50 cm$ , what is the magnitude of the uniform electric field in this region?  

**Question Translation:**  

電視顯像管的電子槍加速板之間的電位差約為 25,000 V，這些板之間的距離為 1.50 cm，求該區域內均勻電場的大小。

**Solution:**  

電通量由公式計算：
 $E = \frac{V}{d}$

- $V = 25000$ V  
- $d = 0.015$ m  

**Answer:**  
$E = \frac{25000}{0.015} = 1.67 \times 10^6 V/m$

(a) Determine the speed of the rod after it has traveled $2.00 m.$  

(b) What If? How does your answer to part (a) change if the electric field is not perpendicular to the rod? Explain.
